# HTTP message structure
# Start line defines HTTP verb to use
# Headers (optional) provides additional info (e.g. message length, cookies, etc)
  name:value
  name:value
# headers must end with a blank line
# message body (optional) can contain any binary or text data

# Verbs - type of request being made and therefore how the server will interpret it
GET # ask server to return a representation of a resource
POST # submit data to a web server
PUT # create or update a representation of a resource on a server (similar to POST)
DELETE # destroy a resource on a server
PATCH # update a portion of a resource (unlike PUT which updates it wholesale)

# Handling multiple routes that should respond the same way
  require 'sinatra'

  ['/one', '/two', '/three'].each do |route|
    get route do
      "Triggered #{route} via GET"
    end
  
    post route do
      "Triggered #{route} via POST"
    end
  end

note: you can make trailing slash optional with '/one/?'

# Remember that the first sufficient match wins, so define the order of your routes carefully (sinatra uses greedy match)

# Halting requests (error handling)
  get '/halt' do
    'You will not see this output'
    halt 500
  end

# Static files
# Sinatra assumes the public folder exists, so you should ommmit it from the route
  get '/prog/mypage.html' # will return the html page in public/prog/ folder

# Views - by default Sinatra will look in the views subfolder
  get '/index' do
    erb :index # will render views/index.erb
  end

# to reference views in subfolders, we need to convert the string representation of the path to a symbol
  get '/:user/:profile' do
    erb '/user/profile'.to_sym #will render /views/user/profile.erb
    # alternative is erb :'/user/profile'
  end

# passing data into views - use instance varaiables!
  get 'home' do
    @name = 'Random User'
    erb :home
  end

  # in the body of the html file...
  <h1>Hello, <%= @name %>!</h1>

  # use <%= %> to evaluate statements (display instance variables, perform operations)
  # use <% %> for control statements (loops, etc...)

# Filters - modify requests and responses, both before and after a route has been executed
  before do
    # do stuff here
  end

  # you can set a URL to match and the filter will only be applied for that route. Otherwise it will always apply.
  before('/index') {...} # executed only before the '/index' route
